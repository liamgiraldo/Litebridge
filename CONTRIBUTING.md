# Contributing
## Adding to the existing project
If you wish to become a contributor to the litebridge plugin, I'd love to talk to you! At the moment, I will not allow direct contributions to the main project. If you wish to build upon litebridge, **please feel free to fork the project** and make changes as you please. Remember to always provide credit where credit is due.

If you want to reach out to me for more information regarding contributions to the plugin, email **litebow@litebow.net**

## Using the code in your own projects
If you add the plugin as a dependency, or use chunks of my code in your own projects, please make sure to give credit where credit is due. In-code credits, mentions in a README, or your plugin page are all valid ways to attribute my work. I learned how to build this plugin by reading and taking other people's code, so don't be afraid to use / look at mine (even though it isn't very good).

## Monetization
**You cannot sell this plugin.** Free distribution of my plugin is permitted, but the selling or monetization of it is prohibited. This plugin was made with the intention of being free, and I will not be making any money off of it. Respect my wishes of keeping it free for server owners to use. Respect developers and respect consumers.

## Consumer Use
Consumers are free to customize the plugin to fit the needs of their server. It is ok to customize scoreboards and command messages. I understand the need for this which is why I allow it to be done consumer side. Not everyone is a developer and I understand that. That being said, if you are a developer, please modify the code to best fit the needs of your server. If you modify the code to fit your needs, you should not expect support directly from me or any developer. You will largely be on your own.
